## Testing

This project is fully tested. We have an [automatic pipeline](https://github.com/laravel-portugal/api/actions) and an [automatic code quality analysis](https://coveralls.io/github/laravel-portugal/api) tool set up to continuously test and assert the quality of all code published in this repository, but you can execute the test suite yourself by running the following command:

``` bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

_Note: This assumes you've run `composer install` (without the `--no-dev` option)._

**We aim to keep the master branch always deployable.** Exceptions may happen, but they should be extremely rare.
